This app is a simple, interactive web application built using Streamlit that performs sentiment analysis on user-inputted text using a pre-trained Hugging Face Transformers pipeline.

🔧 How It Works:
The app uses the pipeline('sentiment-analysis') function from the transformers library to load a pre-trained sentiment classifier.

Users can input any text into a text area.

Once the input is provided, the app analyzes the sentiment and displays:

The sentiment label (e.g., POSITIVE or NEGATIVE)

A confidence score (ranging from 0 to 1) showing how confident the model is in its prediction.
